        <p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center;">From a young age I have always been fascinated by all the different cultures around the world and how each culture varies from the next.
            I am fortunate enough to have been able to travel to many countries in the world already.
            I have journeyed to many different countries in Europe such as France, England, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Czech Republic, Germany and Austria.
            I thoroughly enjoyed travelling around Europe, trying different countries cuisine and meeting new people along the way. However, I found my trips to countries outside Europe, which were a bit further from home, the most exciting.
            I enjoyed my visit to Washington D.C. and New York in America but my adventure to Egypt was my most eye opening trip yet, it was a truly amazing experience.</p>
