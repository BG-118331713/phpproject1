            Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world.
            The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. 
            The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of submersion applied to representation, fiction or simulation.
            Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" (Maurice Benayoun) or "immersant" (Char Davies)'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete suspension of disbelief, enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment.
            The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.
