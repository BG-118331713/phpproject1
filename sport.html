        <p style="color:white;font-size:140%;text-align:center;">I have a great interest in sport. Sport has had a huge impact on my childhood and continues to impact my life now as a young adult.
            Although I enjoy watching and playing many different sports, Rugby and soccer have always been my two favourite sports.
            I have played rugby my whole life with my local club Old Christians RFC , recently moving from underage to adult rugby which has been a tough transition with the hits becoming harder and the pace of the game increasing but I enjoy the new competition.
            I got my love for rugby from my father who played from a very young age himself. Although I do not play soccer, I watch and support the premier league, I support Arsenal FC as my whole family are Arsenal supporters.
            I have been lucky enough to go attend a few Arsenal matches at the Emirates Stadium with my brother who lives in London.</p>
